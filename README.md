# generate-osm-contours
Docker image to generate elevation contours pbf files

## What for?
I've always wondered how mapbox vector tiles are created, why elevation contours are so difficult to find to build my own maps...

So I modified OpenMapTiles toolchain to build my own elevation vector tiles. 

## How to use it
It is already integrated into my Contour branch of OpenMapTiles toolchain.
